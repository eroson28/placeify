    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>
      This is a project based on r/place, a recurring social experiment and collaborative medium hosted annually
      on Reddit. Users can place a single colored tile in a 1000x1000 grid of tiles every minute, emphasizing
      cooperation to build larger images from the communities on the website.
    </p>
    <p> I thought the idea of a project that forces users to collaborate by design was interesting and wanted to
      recreate it myself with a twist &mdash; using songs instead of colored tiles.
    <p>
      The front end for this web app runs on React, and the backend on Node.js using Express. A PostgreSQL database
      stores the tile's song and user data, while Redis is used to enforce a 30-minute per-user cooldown on tile edits,
      a value that is adjustable for future changes. This encourages cooperation by requiring users to be deliberate
      with their changes. The entire application is containerized and deployed on Render.
